# AK-44 — A Master’s Prototype Reborn

---

Recovered from the corrupted memory of a fallen pre-Fall archive, the AK-44 is a volatile relic from the final chapters of Old Earth’s Second World War — a weapon born from raw ambition rather than refinement.

Conceived by the visionary engineer Kuzmichev, it was a prototype built to harness the revolutionary 7.62×41mm cartridge. It promised to merge the precision of a battle rifle with the suppressing storm of a machine gun, but it was a weapon born too soon. On the ancient testing grounds, the rifle fractured under stress and was abandoned, buried by history while simpler weapons took the stage.

Centuries later, fragments of the AK-44’s design were rediscovered on the Rim. Rebuilt from decayed files using modern alloys to cure its historic fragility, the weapon roars again — heavy, rhythmic, and undeniably powerful.

A failed experiment. A master’s vision. Finally given a second chance among the stars.
