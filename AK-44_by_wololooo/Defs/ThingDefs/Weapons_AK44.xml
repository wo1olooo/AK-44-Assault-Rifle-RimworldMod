    <description>The AK-44 is a volatile relic from the final chapters of Old Earth’s Second World War. Conceived by the visionary engineer Kuzmichev, it was a prototype built to harness the revolutionary 7.62×41mm cartridge.

It promised to merge the precision of a battle rifle with the suppressing storm of a machine gun, but it was a weapon born too soon.

On the ancient testing grounds the AK-44 fractured. It was intricate, temperamental, and its mechanisms were too advanced for the crude metallurgy of the time. While rival designs moved forward, Kuzmichev’s prototype was deemed a failure and buried beneath the expanding war machine. It became a ghost meant to fade into silence.

But the Rim offers second chances to even the most broken things.

Salvaged from the corrupted memory core of a derelict freighter, the blueprints were resurrected by a weaponsmith who saw potential where history saw defeat.

Rebuilt with modern alloys that cure its original fragility, the AK-44 has been reborn as a heavy, brutal instrument of war. It kicks with the anger of a forgotten soldier and serves the desperate colonists of the frontier with a reliability it was denied on Earth. A master’s rejected vision finally finding its victory among the stars.
