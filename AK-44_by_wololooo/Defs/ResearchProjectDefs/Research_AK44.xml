	<description>The AK-44 is the rough draft of a legend. Forged by Sergeant Kuzmischev during Old Earth’s bloodiest war, it was a raw attempt to define the future of automatic warfare. But never made it to the front, a prototype lost in time.

Though overshadowed and buried by time, the design has been salvaged from the archives of a derelict freighter. Rebuilt to feed the rare 7.62×41mm rounds, it lacks polish but possesses an unbreakable heart. A legend’s origin story, finally told at the edge of the universe.
