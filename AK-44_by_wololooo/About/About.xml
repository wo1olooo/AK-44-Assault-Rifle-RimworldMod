  <description>The AK-44 is the rough draft of a legend. Forged by the young Sergeant Kalashnikov during the final throes of Old Earth’s bloodiest war, it was a raw attempt to define the future of automatic warfare using the experimental 7.62×41mm cartridge.

But on the ancient testing grounds, it was overshadowed. Eclipsed by the rival AS-44 and the shifting tides of doctrine, the prototype was deemed too heavy and the ammunition too scarce. It was discarded as a footnote, buried by time while its successors conquered the world.

Yet the Rim is a place of second chances. Salvaged from the corrupted memory banks of a derelict freighter, the AK-44 has been resurrected by smiths who recognize the seed of greatness.

Rebuilt to feed the rare 7.62×41mm rounds, it is no longer a forgotten prototype but a weapon of pure function. It lacks the polish of the empire it would later spawn, but it possesses an unbreakable heart. It cycles with a rhythmic, brutal reliability. A legend’s origin story finally told at the edge of the universe.
